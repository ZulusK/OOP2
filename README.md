### Lab1
1. Use the Bridge template to create
program calculator, which works in 2 modes: the usual calculator
(provides support for 4 basic mathematical operations: adding,
subtraction, multiplication, division) and engineer calculator (provides
support of 4 basic mathematical operations, as well as mining
square root, computation of the remainder from division, elevation of the number to
a given degree).
2. Using the design template to implement the mechanism
selling cosmetics through a network of distributors (network marketing).
Everyone can be either the ultimate seller of cosmetics, or
the manager of a certain number of subordinate sellers, to whom he sells the goods.
Each manager sells cosmetics at a certain percentage more expensive than he
she got it. But to exceed the final retail price of the product,
the distributor has no right established by the company.
